When I was seven, instead of sending me to an woodsy sleep away camp like most kids, my parents decided to send me to an all girls computer camp. This was the right choice, as I certainly wasn't an "outdoor kid" and a summer canoeing on the lake or learn archery was laughable. So I spent an awesome, air conditioned summer playing SimCity and learning MS Paint. This was 1991, and although it was certainly a lession in programing, it set up my lifelong love of technology.

I took several programing classes in high school, which I loved and exceled in, but as is the case is for many, life would bring me down a different path. I was on my own at 19, and needed to be able to support myself. This led to a very sucessful career in retail management, which for many years was satisfying, engaging, lucrative, and challenged my brain daily. Despite that, 10 years into this career, I started to feel "The Itch".


I'm sure lots of people are familiar with "The Itch". That feeling like you need more; more thinking, more challenge, more impact. The calling of unfufilled potencial. The knowledge that you could be using your brain to do more.  I started to think long and hard about what I love and what motivates me, and decided made the time to explore and pursue those things. 

I started dabbling around with some free coding classes, and soon was hooked. I had never felt me brain work so hard, and be so satified with the results! My itch was scratched! I soon started researching bootcamps, left my job, and started my journey to a career in web development. Everyday so far has been an amazing challenge with up and downs, and I have never been more excited about my path ahead.

Cheers to a new year full of change, learning, and scratching the itch!
